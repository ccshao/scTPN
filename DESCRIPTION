Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chunxuan Shao
Maintainer: Chunxuan Shao <c.shao@dkfz-heidelberg.de>
Description: Infer a gene regulation network (GRN) based on partial correlation and TF bindings for scRNA-seq data. 
    A consensus GRN is built on sampling of cells, and further constrained by TF bindings among pair of TFs.
